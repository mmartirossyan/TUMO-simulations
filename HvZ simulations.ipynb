    "Physicists use mathematical models and computational tools to study complex behaviors in populations. Examples of such models include predator/prey models (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations), or the SIR model (susceptible - infected - removed: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model) which we use to model disease spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we are not going to delve into the complex mathematics behind such models, but take a particular model and study its behavior. We're going to use the \"HZ model\" -- H for humans, Z for zombies as the two populations in question (this is loosely based off the SIR model for those who are curious). We will consider two main actions: zombies biting humans and turning them into zombies, and humans killing zombies. We will define the rates of those actions: the `biteRate`, and the `killRate`. Based on those two rates, we can use something called the Gillespie algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillespie_algorithm) to step forward in time and see how our population sizes change."

    "The default is set to a very low number of vaccinated humans and a high number of zombies. Run the simulation 5 times with the defaults: what happens? Is this what you would expect? Do the populations of the humans vs. the vaccinated humans change differently?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, up the number of vaccinated humans `V0` to be around half of the total humans. Do your simulation results change? How so, and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, increase `biteFactor` to 0.002 and keep the number of vaccinated humans at around half of total humans. Do your simulation results differ from the previous two cases? How so, and why? In this case, how many vaccinated humans would we need in order to be guaranteed for humans to beat the zombies?\n",
    "\n",
    "Although vaccination is a key tactic for minimizing zombie spread, the number of humans that we need vaccinated depends strongly on how good the zombies are at biting the humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last, try pushing up the `vax_protection` to 0.9, while keeping the `biteFactor` at 0.002 and the number of vaccinated humans at around half of total humans. What happens now? How is it different from the previous results?"
